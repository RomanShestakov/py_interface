{abstract,"The py_interface provides the possibility to create a node 
that may be used for communication with other Erlang nodes.

Some characteristics:
* The Python nodes are hidden, like the Java nodes
* The Python node supports
  - registering the Python node in the epmd
  - sending and receiving message
  - executing remote procedure calls (the rpc:call(M,F,A) mechanism)
* The Python node does currently _not_ do:
  - linking
  - tracing
* The Python node translates Erlang types to Python types as far as
  there is a reasonable Python counterpart. If there is not, then
  a class is used.
* The Python node is a single threaded callback-driven process.
* The Python node is released under LGPL, see the file COPYING.LIB.
* The Python node runs on Python 1.5 -- Python 2.2. It
  can talk to Erlang R7 and R8 nodes, as far as I know.
* The source of information for this Python node has been the files
  `distribution_handshake.txt' and `erl_ext_dist.txt' together with
  the Java node source files, the `net_kernel.erl' and the
  `dist_util.erl' files in the Erlang source code distribution."}.
